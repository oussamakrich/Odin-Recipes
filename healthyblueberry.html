		<h1>Healty Blueberry</h1>	
			<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A quick recipe I thought up while trying to decide what to eat for <br> breakfast. Great if you are trying to figure out what to do with those <br>blueberries in the fridge or freezer! Also great on-the-go! <br>Delicious and includes many foods that are a great way to start your day! Many of the ingredients, except for the blueberries and yogurt,<br> are optional and vary depending on your own taste. I love cinnamon and a thick, super-cold smoothie. This recipe is super <br>versatile, and you can change it depending on dietary needs or personal preference. Have fun with it!</p>
